= Why should I embed content from the PlayBuzz network? =
Our content is created by our network of partners and our editorial staff. We feature highly engaging items around many popular topics. Embedding these items on your site is likely to boost all of your engagement metrics- page views, ad impressions, time spent online, sharing rate, etc. Above all- it enhances your site’s content offering by complementing it with content packaged in an extremely engaging and viral way.

= Does PlayBuzz help me make my content viral? =
Absolutely. Our plugin includes an option to share each content item on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Any click on these share buttons will create a share link directing users to your website.

= Does PlayBuzz work on mobile and tablet versions of my site? =
Yes. PlayBuzz's UI is responsive and mobile compatible.

= Can I create my own content? = 
Absolutely. We encourage you to create original playful content using (http://www.playbuzz.com). You may then decide to keep this content private (embed on your website only) or public (enable other partners on the PlayBuzz network to embed your content on their sites as well).

= Does this plugin slow down my website? = 
No. Test and see for yourself. PlayBuzz is using a large content delivery network to ensure prompt delivery.
